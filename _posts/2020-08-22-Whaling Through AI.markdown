Whaling dates back to the early 1800s. Most recently, professors from [Harvard Business School](https://qz.com/707832/why-harvard-business-school-teaches-students-about-whaling/)  brought this age old strategy back in the form of a business case. The case explains whaling through the following example:

>*In October 1823, the crew of the whaling ship Atletico sights and harpoons a sperm whale. Sperm whales, prized for producing an oil that didn’t give a harsh odor when burned, were famously difficult to hunt. The safe practice was to follow the wounded animal until it was tired enough to be killed without putting up much of a fight. But the Atletico lost track of its prize, and two days later, the whale was spotted and harpooned again by the Botafogo. That ship, too, eventually lost track of the whale. It was a third ship, the Corinthian, that found the exhausted animal. The crew harvested the blubber and ambergris, earning $11,580, equivalent to $245,000 in today’s dollars.*

But whaling applies to artificial intelligence too.

While one company might lay the foundation for Artificial Intelligence, spending countless hours and manpower at research to develop the next game changing AI engine. It may be a totally different incumbent or disruptor that manages to reap the benefits of their hard work.

Take for instance, Alphabet. Alphabet’s US$ 400 million acquisition of Deepmind, an AI startup has borne significant fruit. DeepMind has been used to find the quickest route between underground stations, defeat champion players of the board game ‘Go’, and improve healthcare. But here’s the interesting part. Alphabet didn’t do anything. It simply whaled it’s way through the waters (marketplace) and identified the right moment to scoop the right whale (Deepmind) and milk it for what it was good for (game changing AI).
