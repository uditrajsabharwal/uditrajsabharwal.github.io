I cracked the SSCBS entrance way back in 2012. Yup! Five years, that’s how long it has been. With barely 80 percent in Class XII coupled with Science and Economics, I was literally waging a war to make sure I got an undergraduate education.

Eventually it worked out all fine. I ended up at SSCBS and spent three years in Jhilmil which virtually transformed my life.

Here’s to anyone hoping to live that dream:

**Join a Test Prep**: I went to Pratham and believe me it was worth it. Obviously the choice is up to you. But choose an institute based on past record. Always get in touch with ex-students cause they are the best judge. Why test prep? Imagine running a race on a rocky surface with spikes. Everyone else has running shoes and you are running bare feet. The running shoes are test prep. They put you on a similar< if not higher pedestal than your peers. Not saying that you can’t crack the exam without test prep, just asking you to choose wisely.

**Work your ass off**: There are four sections. Verbal, Quantitative Aptitude, Logical Reasoning and General Awareness. Make sure you ace these sections. Weak in math. Not a problem. Make sure you get a passing grade in one section and ace the remainders. Remember practice, practice, practice.

**Books**: Here’s the thing. If you join a test prep – you are covered. But in case you want to venture out into the unknown. Grab a copy of RS Aggarwal’s Quantitative Aptitude, Verbal and Non Verbal Reasoning and Arihant’s BBA entrance book

**Newspaper**: You need to give an interview or a group discussion (depending on the mood of the university) and bored faculty members get a kick out of troubling the bonkers out of you. So spend time with a newspaper as if it were your boyfriend or girlfriend and that relationship will turn out just fine.

**Mocks and Previous Years**: A mock gives you an indication of where you stand. Set up a proper test environment and give it religiously and analyze the living hell out of that mock so that you don’t repeat your mistakes. Also, get your hands on the previous year papers. These papers are going to give you an indication of what areas you need to focus on. They might not be readily available and you might need to skim them out of seniors.

**Live the dream**: Watch Billions or House of Lies or Wall Street and Wall Street 2 or Silicon Valley and you will feel inspired to get a degree and become the real life version of one of these fictional characters. Alternatively, read about Elon Musk, Steve Jobs and the like
