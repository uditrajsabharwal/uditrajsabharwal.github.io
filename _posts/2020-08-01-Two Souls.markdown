Who are you and whom am I?

We are but two souls under this sky

What is life and what is death?

Each one sooner or later you would have met

What is love and what is despair?

For nothing in this world was ever fair

What is right and what is wrong?

To make a decision why do you take so long

What is sin and what is virtue?

When nothing in this world s true

Who are you and whom am I?

We are just two souls under this sky
