Dancing in a shadowy rain

Prided with glory like the lion’s mane

Just holding each other as close as you can

Feeling the rain drops pour as they may

And you only wish you could lay

In the rain and forget everything

And you both would just sing

About your love and lust

And your story could shake the earth’s crust

You are madly in love and I see it now

For when I know, I believe it

And as I see it, I know it

So as you dance in the rain

I will go insane

For I am in love with you again
