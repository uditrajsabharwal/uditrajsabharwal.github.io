The little seedling was planted underground

They made sure that no one made a single sound

Bearing the brunt of the brutal heat

And the thrust of those thumping feet

Those water droplets in the rain

And that heart breaking inner pain

Fighting for it’s way for life

Just in order to survive

Breaking through the ground to seek the light

The little seedling put up a brave fight

Then the world hatched an evil plot

The seedling however tough he fought

Was crushed by their outer strength

And with the blow that was tenth

He fell down in a puddle of deep darkness

And life seemed but a big dark mess

And so the wisdom tree preached in vain

That life is but a memory lane

Being nostalgic it’s very game!!
