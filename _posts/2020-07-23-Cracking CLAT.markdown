I gave the CLAT way back in 2012. It’s been more than 5 years. The CLAT is now online and has negative marking. But there’s that old saying - The more things change, the more they remain the same.

As CLAT rolls out another edition and I get multiple requests to answer questions related to CLAT, I decided to pen this post - which is aptly titled - The Ultimate Guide to Cracking the CLAT.

Four different 12 graders got together and brainstormed career options post giving a disastrous board examination in the science stream. They reverse engineered the CLAT in a span of 15 days and ended up in WBNUJS, GNLU and Jindal Law School respectively. Here’s what they did:

**Join a coaching institute**: Doesn’t matter which one. Leverage the Quantitative Aptitude, Logical Reasoning, Legal Aptitude and Verbal material to the fullest. Read, Revise, Repeat (3 Times)

**Read a newspaper**: The HINDU preferably. The sports section or Delhi Times does not count as reading

**Lick the Pratiyogita Darpans**: These are your Bibles. Read the 12 editions from May to May. If you cover these, General Knowledge is covered.

**Get Inspired and Leverage Compendiums**: CLATGyan. Single Website that is overloaded with content. They have monthly compendiums and an annual compendium. The annual compendium reinstates everything you have read from the Pratiyogita Darpans. They also have a plethora of articles from current law students and their journey of cracking the CLAT.

**Get your hands on Arihant and Universal’s law guide**: Universal has a fairly decent Quantitative and static GK section while Arihant covers the other areas. You don’t need to do these books cover to cover but solve the exercises whenever you are low and need to feel good about CLAT preparation.

**MOCKS**: We used two mock tests. One from Pratham and another from CLATGyan. The CLATGyan mocks made us cry. But we managed to take them in our stride and come out on top.

**Previous Years Papers**: There is a rare book by Universal that publishes questions from the Previous Years Papers of all Law Entrances. One of my friends had to call fifteen shops before he found it. But what he found was indeed gold. My entire legal section, I was able to ace because questions were virtually repeated with not even a change in the options. So do these religiously.

**Read a John Grisham**: Every fortnight race though a novel as you would read a Chetan Bhagat to truly imbibe the profession you want to step into.
Hope this helps!
