Let me write you a story

Let me sing you a song

Let me be by your side

Let me run along

Let us walk together

In moonlights forever

Let us dance in the rains

And share our pains..

Let me hold your hand

Let us do things that are unplanned

Let me never forget you

Let us hope that we never have to start anew

Let me love you forever

Let me show you that lifeâ€™s grayer

Let me be

Let it be..
