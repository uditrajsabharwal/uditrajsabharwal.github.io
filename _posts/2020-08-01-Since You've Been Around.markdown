Lately it’s been a little strange

Cause I have been happy for a change

The sky seems but bluer and the stars seem so bright

I seem to run for no reason to destinations out of my sight

I laugh and joke and I dance all night

For some reason things just seem to be all right

And I realize that I am living a piece of me

A piece that was lost in memory

For I am reliving my dreams

And thinking of this my heart beams

For something’s changed something’s lost and something’s found

It all seems all right since you have been around!
