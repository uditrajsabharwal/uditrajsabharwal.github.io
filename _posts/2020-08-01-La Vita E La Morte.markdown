On this very day

I have nothing much to say

What is there to do?

There is no fun, nothing new..

Why am I stuck right here..

When all I dream is of there..

What have I got to do..

To just say adieu

I can’t really remember the days gone by

All I think of is why I should die..

I am not crazy, neither insane

I just want to walk down that empty lane

For life today has no meaning..

You can carry on without a feeling

But as it is nothing new, nothing great

Sooner or later this is what you’ll hate

For the world ain’t shimmery it’s really bleak

And if happiness is what you seek

Then the journey it’s only begun

And you have miles. Yes. Miles to run

For the greatest men weren’t made in a day

And with that I sadly say

A lifetime worth of hard work

For a pinch of greatness worth

It’s nothing great

For it comes real late

So just carry on or look at death

For till your last breath

You’ll recall this in the back of your head

And when you are simply dead

You’ll remember that

Death was really a long way down..
