O lost soul where are you headed to in this time

Why do you lead a life of shame, misery and crime

Why don’t you practice being, right here and now

Why don’t you question the what, when and how?

Awaiting a miracle which never seems to come

You are immersed in your state high on cigarette and rum

Time flies past you and you are losing sight

Of vision, your future and your might

Your experiences and dreams are but long gone

Followed by your beauty and brawn

Why do you look like a withered flower

One who has in a long time not visited the shower

Even holy men like monks exude cheerfulness

Yet all you are is a horrible mess

In your race to take over time

Perhaps, my friend, you have committed your biggest crime
