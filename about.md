I work as a Management Consultant with [CBRE](https://www.cbre.com/), a global real estate company. I spend a greater part of my day helping clients solve complex business problems and build distinct advantages for their Real Estate portfolios, Data Centers, Workforce and Supply Chains.

Before this, I was based in New Delhi with [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/sg-en) where I worked as a thought leader shaping business thinking around digital, technology and the future of manufacturing.

I blog here writing about a range of topics and on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Udit-Sabharwal-1). This site is minimalistic pretty similar to how I like to live my life. Topics I write about span areas such as my notes from books & podcasts, skills I have been looking to build, poetry I have written over the years, my views on consulting, thought leadership and technology and a whole lot more.

I was in the search of the perfect blogging platform and I think I found it this year with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The website is largely inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/). And the theme is a fork of the one by [Sergio Kopplin](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo).
